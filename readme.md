## Prehistoric Involution

![Test Passing](https://github.com/Aperocky/prehistoric-simulation/workflows/Unit%20Tests/badge.svg)

This is intended to be a cleaner and more feature rich version of [Prehistoric](https://github.com/Aperocky/prehistoric)

Re-architected due to messy code in the original project, wanting to try out chai unit test framework, and that typing on the new M1 air has been very pleasant.

### How it works

The simulation are based on randomly generated terrain, where prehistoric people and households live and multiply. They exchange goods through markets, and occasionally congregates in cities and metropolitan locations.

### More features envisioned:

1. City states, warfare and citizenship.
2. Different type of governance.
3. Personality and other personal traits - to affect job conversion and others.
